## 🎓 What I Learned

### 1. AI Strengths
- ✅ Excellent at boilerplate code
- ✅ Great for documentation
- ✅ Perfect for standard patterns
- ✅ Fast at debugging
- ✅ Good at explaining complex code

### 2. AI Limitations
- ❌ Needs specific prompts
- ❌ Sometimes generates outdated syntax
- ❌ Can't test code automatically
- ❌ Doesn't know your exact setup
- ❌ Requires validation

### 3. Best Practices Discovered
1. **Be specific in prompts** - More detail = better code
2. **Iterate incrementally** - Build feature by feature
3. **Always test AI code** - Don't assume it works
4. **Use AI for documentation** - Saves massive time
5. **Combine multiple AI tools** - Each has strengths

---

## 🔄 Iterative Development Process

### Typical Workflow

1. **Describe feature to AI**
   ```
   "Create a Discord command for checking FLOW balance"
   ```

2. **AI generates code**
   - Receives complete implementation
   - Reviews code structure
   - Checks for errors

3. **Test & refine**
   - Run code
   - Find issues
   - Ask AI to fix

4. **Iterate**
   ```
   "Add error handling for when user is not registered"
   ```

5. **Repeat**

### Example Iteration

**Iteration 1**:
> "Create tip command"

**Iteration 2**:
> "Add balance checking before tip"

**Iteration 3**:
> "Add notification to recipient"

**Iteration 4**:
> "Make error messages more user-friendly"

Each iteration took 2-3 minutes instead of 20-30 minutes manually.

3. Use AI for test case generation
4. Ask for more code comments upfront

### Advice for Others
1. **Don't be afraid to ask** - AI is patient
2. **Iterate freely** - Refinement is fast
3. **Validate everything** - AI makes mistakes
4. **Use for learning** - Ask AI to explain code
5. **Combine tools** - Use multiple AI assistants
